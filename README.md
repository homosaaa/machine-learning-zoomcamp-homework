📚 Summary of First Session – Machine Learning Zoomcamp
🚗 Introduction to Machine Learning with Cars Data

We start with data about cars, including characteristics (features) and prices (target).
A Machine Learning (ML) model can be used to extract patterns from known information (data) about some cars in order to predict car prices based on their characteristics.

🧠 Rules-Based Systems vs. Machine Learning

Rules-Based Systems:

Requires manually converting rules into code using a programming language.

Extracting patterns manually can become complex and challenging.

Machine Learning:

ML models automatically extract patterns from data using Mathematics and Statistics.

No need to manually code rules.

🔍 Supervised Machine Learning

In supervised learning, models learn from labeled data (with known outcomes) to make predictions on unseen data.

🛠️ CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)

A structured methodology for organizing ML projects, consisting of the following steps:

💼 Business Understanding

🔎 Data Understanding

🧹 Data Preparation

🤖 Modeling – choosing and training models, then selecting the best one

📊 Evaluation

🚀 Deployment

This process is iterative, allowing for continuous improvement.

🏆 Model Selection

Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

Train different models, validate them, select the best performing one.

Test the best model on the test set to ensure generalization.

💻 Setting Up the Environment

Install necessary tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Anaconda is the easiest option for setup.

Eventually, create an AWS account for cloud resources.

🔢 Introduction to NumPy

NumPy is crucial for manipulating numerical data, providing efficient operations on arrays and matrices.

🔗 Linear Algebra

Covers all types of multiplication with vectors and matrices.

Includes the creation of identity matrices using functions like np.eye().

📊 Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a Python library used for processing and analyzing tabular data efficiently.
